### Readme

This repository includes some of the scripts that allow to replicate some of the results presented in the manuscript:
*"Observation of falling snowflakes orientation in sheltered and unsheltered sites"* by Grazioli et al., submitted to GRL in 2024.

In particular, the script:

- *Validation_ellipsoid_fitting.py* can be used to replicate the ellipsoid simulations (e.g., left panels of Fig.2 in the submitted manuscript)
- *aggproj-simulations.py* can be used to replicate the simulated aggregates simulations (e.g., right panels of Fig.2 in the submitted manuscript)

The results that instead make use of field-collected data, can be replicated with *[a script included in the MASCdb package](https://github.com/ltelab/pymascdb/blob/master/tutorial/07_orientation.py)*

### Special requirements
Apart from standard packages, the *[aggregation](https://github.com/jleinonen/aggregation)* library must be installed
